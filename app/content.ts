  brief_description:
    "I'm a developer and designer exploring the space where code meets emotion. I build real-time, multiplayer web apps, expressive interfaces, and experiments in color, motion, and geometry. From system architecture to micro-interactions, I care about how things workâ€”and how they feel. Currently building projects like Color Mathlab and Graveyard, blending intent with interaction.",
